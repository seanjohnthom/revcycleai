POST #1: Cigna/Zelis Network Expansion
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

🚨 Cigna Just Expanded Its Zelis Network Leasing — Here's What Dental Practices Need to Know

Cigna has quietly expanded its leasing arrangement with Zelis Healthcare (formerly Maverest), now including additional dental and medical procedures under the repricing umbrella.

Translation? More claims are getting repriced at lower rates — even if you thought you had a direct Cigna contract.

What to do NOW:
✅ Audit your last 90 days of Cigna EOBs
✅ Look for "Zelis Healthcare" or "Maverest" in repricing notes
✅ Verify your network routing path (direct vs. leased)
✅ Calculate revenue impact if repricing has already started

This is classic silent PPO behavior — and it's costing practices 5-15% on affected claims.

The good news? Once you identify it, you can fix it. Network routing is solvable.

POST #2: UnitedHealthcare Prior Auth Expansion
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

🔔 UnitedHealthcare Prior Auth Requirements Expanding March 1st — Are You Ready?

UnitedHealthcare just announced they're expanding prior authorization requirements to include additional outpatient surgical procedures and imaging studies, effective March 1, 2026.

If you're not reviewing updated policy guidelines right now, you're setting yourself up for denials.

What changes:
• More outpatient procedures now require pre-auth
• Imaging studies added to the authorization list
• Tighter documentation requirements across the board

Revenue cycle teams have exactly 7 days to:
1. Review UHC's updated policy guidelines
2. Update your authorization tracking workflows
3. Train front desk + scheduling staff on new requirements
4. Set up automation triggers for newly covered procedures

The worst-case scenario? Claims sitting in limbo for 30+ days while you scramble to get retroactive authorizations (which UHC rarely approves).

Don't let preventable denials blow up your AR aging.

POST #3: Humana/Zelis Transition
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

⚠️ Humana Dental Is Moving More Plans to Zelis Repricing — Check Your Contracts

Humana Dental just announced it's transitioning additional plan types to utilize Zelis Healthcare's network leasing arrangement for claim repricing.

If you have a direct Humana contract, you might THINK you're getting Humana rates. But if they've moved your patients' plans to Zelis repricing, you're actually getting leased network rates — which can be 10-20% lower.

Here's the problem:
Most practices don't find out until the EOB arrives. By then, the claim is already adjudicated at the lower rate.

Action items:
📋 Verify which Humana plans remain under direct contract
📋 Identify which plans have moved to Zelis leasing
📋 Update your eligibility verification scripts
📋 Calculate revenue impact on affected patient base

Silent PPO leakage is real, and Zelis/Maverest/DNOA umbrella networks are the #1 culprit.
