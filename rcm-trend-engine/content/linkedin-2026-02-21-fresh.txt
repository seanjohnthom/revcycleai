POST #1: AI Spend Control ($32B Story)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

🤖 If AI Can Save $32 Billion on Vendor Invoices, Why Aren't We Using It on Claims?

Four health systems just deployed AI to validate service invoices before payment. The result? They're preventing $32 billion in annual overpayments across a $323 billion spend category.

Here's how it works:
AI encodes contract terms into code → validates every invoice line against terms → flags discrepancies automatically → no manual approvals needed.

Now ask yourself: If AI can catch vendor overpayments BEFORE they happen, why are we still submitting claims AFTER denials hit?

The revenue cycle industry is using AI backwards.

We're deploying it to predict denials (after the claim is already wrong), appeal denials (after we've already lost), and track A/R (after cash flow is already damaged).

But AI's real power is UPSTREAM:
✅ Validate claims against payor contracts before submission
✅ Encode medical necessity criteria into real-time edits
✅ Flag coding errors before the claim goes out the door
✅ Automate prior auth validation (not prediction)

The lesson from vendor invoice AI isn't about supply chain.

It's about shifting from reactive to proactive. From damage control to damage prevention.

Your claims are just invoices to payors. Treat them like it.

POST #2: Payer Mix Crisis
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

📉 Hospital Volumes Are Up. Revenue Is Flat. Here's Why.

Kaufman Hall just released their National Hospital Flash Report tracking 1,300+ hospitals.

The finding that should terrify every CFO:

"Higher patient volumes are NOT translating into stronger financial results."

Why? Payer mix deterioration.

More uninsured patients. More government program coverage. Fewer commercially insured patients. Result: same volume, worse margins.

The gap between gross revenue and net revenue keeps widening. Bad debt is climbing. Charity care is climbing. And the math doesn't work anymore.

You can't control who walks through your door. But you CAN control:

1️⃣ Eligibility verification upstream - Catch coverage gaps BEFORE service
2️⃣ Point-of-service collections - Don't bill what you can collect upfront
3️⃣ Network optimization - Drop low-reimbursing contracts, keep profitable ones
4️⃣ Service line portfolio strategy - Not all volume is good volume

The Kaufman Hall report says high-performers are "nimbler on managing revenue AND expenses."

Translation: They know which patients, which services, and which payors generate margin. And they optimize accordingly.

If you're chasing volume without tracking payer mix, you're running faster on a treadmill.

POST #3: Medicare Advantage Growth Collapse
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

⚠️ Medicare Advantage Just Hit a Wall — And Your Revenue Cycle Needs to Adapt

MA enrollment grew 7-10% annually from 2017-2024.

In 2025? 1% growth.
In 2026? Projected 1-3%.

UnitedHealthcare is LOSING 1.3-1.4 million MA members this year. Humana gained members but margins collapsed. CVS Health pulled back entirely.

What's happening?
• CMS gave MA insurers <1% reimbursement increase
• $30 billion in funding cuts over 3 years
• Insurers are slashing benefits to stay profitable

Why this matters for RCM teams:

Medicare Advantage now covers 55% of Medicare beneficiaries. But not all MA plans are created equal anymore.

Some MA plans are:
❌ Cutting reimbursement rates
❌ Adding more prior auth requirements
❌ Denying claims at higher rates
❌ Delaying payments longer

Your 2024 MA contract analysis is already outdated.

Action items for Q1 2026:
1. Re-analyze your MA contracts by plan (not just insurer)
2. Calculate true reimbursement rate after denials + delays
3. Identify which MA plans are underwater
4. Build a termination roadmap for bottom 20%
5. Reallocate resources to profitable contracts

The MA market is consolidating. Winners will be practices that recognize it early and optimize their network portfolio accordingly.
