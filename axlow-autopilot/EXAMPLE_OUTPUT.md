**POST COPY:**

You've been on hold with UnitedHealthcare for 38 minutes.

Your question: Does UHC require prior auth for CPT 99203 with modifier 25?

The rep finally picks up. "Let me transfer you to authorizations."

*Click.*

You're back at the start of the queue.

Your biller could've filed 14 claims in that time. Instead, she's listening to hold music and questioning her career choices.

This is the daily reality for RCM teams. Not once in a while. Daily.

Axlow answers that UHC question in 11 seconds. With the policy section, page number, and last-updated date.

**POST COPY:**

"I recovered $14,000 in denied claims in my first week using Axlow."

— Sarah M., Revenue Cycle Manager at a multi-specialty practice in Texas

Her team was sitting on 120 denied claims. Most were denials over coverage disputes — "no prior auth," "out of network," "not medically necessary."

The problem? They didn't have time to appeal. Researching each claim's payor policy took too long.

With Axlow, Sarah's team verified coverage policies in seconds. They filed 87 appeals. 42 overturned.

$14,000 recovered in one week.

That's the power of instant access to the right information.

What's sitting in your denial queue right now?
