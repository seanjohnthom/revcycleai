# Session Notes — February 20, 2026

## Morning Session (6:00 AM - 7:47 AM CT)

### RCM Trend Engine — Fixed & Enhanced
- **6:00 AM cron fired** — First automated daily scan successful
- **Telegram delivery fixed** — Updated cron to use correct chat ID (8183551773) instead of invalid target
- Detected 5 high-priority trends from 14 RSS feeds:
  1. CMS Prior Auth MA Requirements (38 pts, IMMEDIATE)
  2. MetLife PDP Plus Changes (35 pts, IMMEDIATE)
  3. Cigna/Zelis Expansion (33 pts, 24H)
  4. UHC Prior Auth Expansion (32 pts, IMMEDIATE)
  5. Humana/Zelis Transition (31 pts, 24H)
- LinkedIn post generated and sent to Telegram (copy/paste ready)
- **Auto blog post generation built** — New feature added to daily cron

### Auto Blog Post Generation — NEW FEATURE
- Built `blog_generator.py` — Full 800-1000 word blog post generator
- Converts top trend (score ≥30) into complete article with:
  - What Changed section
  - Impact on Your Organization (small vs large)
  - 48-Hour Action Plan (actionable checklist)
  - Tools & Resources (auto-inserts Axlow/PayorMap CTAs when relevant)
  - Looking Ahead conclusion
- **First auto-generated post deployed:**
  - Live at: revcycleai.com/blog/cms-finalizes-prior-authorization-requirements-for-medicare
  - Blog index now shows 4 total posts
  - Sitemap updated
- **Daily cron updated** — Now runs: Scan → LinkedIn post → Blog post → Telegram summary
- RevCycleAI is now a **fully automated content engine** — new SEO blog post every morning

### LinkedIn OAuth — Completed (with delays)
- **SSL certificate error fixed** — Replaced `urllib` with `requests` library in linkedin_auth.py and linkedin_poster.py
- **OAuth flow completed successfully** at 6:46 AM CT
- Token saved to `.linkedin_token.json` — valid for 60 days (expires ~April 21)
- **Credentials:**
  - Client ID: 86tgxjfrv6of5b
  - Client Secret: WPL_AP1.r1I5xKhlEnSETrE0.F4jpaA==
- **Status: BLOCKED on API permissions**
  - Getting 403 ACCESS_DENIED: "Not enough permissions to access: organizationAcls"
  - OAuth token is valid, but LinkedIn backend hasn't activated w_organization_social permission yet
  - "Share on LinkedIn" shows approved in dashboard, but API permissions take 2-6 hours to propagate
  - Expected to activate by noon-2pm CT
  - For now: LinkedIn posts saved to `/content/linkedin-*.txt` for manual copy/paste

### Multi-Source Email Enrichment — Built
- **Problem:** Hunter.io free tier exhausted (25/mo), credits reset March 1st
- **Solution:** Built fallback chain system in `email_enrichment.py`
- **Fallback chain:** Hunter.io (25/mo) → Apollo.io (60/mo) → Pattern matching (unlimited at 50% confidence)
- **Apollo.io API added:** w0wN4Vkn79X_6cmd3a9XUA
- **Skrapp.io skipped** — They paywall API access even on free tier
- **Total capacity:** 85 verified emails/month + unlimited pattern matching
- **Pattern matching working** — firstname.lastname@domain.com (most common B2B format)
- Discovery: Apollo.io `/people/match` endpoint requires paid plan (free tier changed recently)
- **Final capacity:** 25 verified (Hunter.io) + unlimited pattern matching (50% confidence)
- Monday lead hunter will use this for Axlow prospecting
- Config updated: `/workspace/axlow-autopilot/leads/config.json`

### Kalshi Auto-Scaling — Built
- **New feature:** Position sizes now scale automatically as bankroll grows
- **Scaling tiers:**
  - < $50: $2.50 max (10% of bankroll)
  - $50-$99: $5 max (2x position size)
  - $100-$249: $10 max (4x position size)
  - $250-$499: $20 max (8x position size)
  - $500+: $40 max (16x position size)
- **Risk controls unchanged:**
  - Quarter-Kelly sizing (0.25x)
  - 15% max bankroll cap
  - 5% min edge
  - Max 8 positions
  - $4.50 cash reserve
- Function added: `get_max_position_for_balance(balance)` in position_manager.py
- Updated both `calculate_position_size()` and `can_open_position()` to use dynamic max
- Documentation: `/workspace/kalshi-bot/SCALING.md`
- Current balance: $18.75 → still in $2.50 tier
- Need +$31.25 to unlock $5 max positions

### Kalshi Daily Report Time Changed
- Moved from 9:00 PM CT → **7:00 PM CT**
- Cron ID: ff962c14-01e8-4037-b732-75434b5a68da

  - P&L: +$0.10 (1W / 0L, 100% win rate)
  - Balance: $18.75 | Deployed: $6.77 | Cash: $11.98
  - Settled: CLE vs BKN ✅ +$0.10
  - Open: 5 positions (including 2 accidental shorts with max loss $4.72)
- GDP trades settle today (Feb 20) — first real test of edge model

### RevCycleAI Pro — Strategy Pivot
- **Original plan:** Build advanced denial benchmarking tool with multi-payor analysis
- **Problem:** Tool needs user data connection we don't have
- **Decision:** Pivot Pro to **pure content tier**
- **New Pro focus:**
  - Premium resource library (20+ templates, playbooks, guides)
  - Weekly premium reports (deep-dive, email-only)
  - Early access to blog posts
  - Remove non-functional tools
- **Removed:** `/tools/denials-pro/` (advanced benchmarking tool)
- **Building:** Premium resource library
  - Started batch creation of 15-20 resources
  - First 3 created:
    1. UHC Prior Auth Strategy Guide (PDF)
    2. Contract Negotiation ROI Calculator (Excel)
    3. Aetna Medical Necessity Appeal Template (PDF)
  - Remaining 12-17 in progress
- **Content philosophy:** RevCycleAI = content hub; Axlow + PayorMap = actual tools

### Newsletter Automation — Complete
- `newsletter_builder.py` built
- Auto-generates HTML email from top 5 trends (past 7 days)
- Sends via MailerLite API
- Tuesday 7am CT cron scheduled (ID: 4e65e54f)
- Structure: Cover story + 3 developing stories + Pro CTA + Free resources CTA + Axlow/PayorMap house ads + advertise CTA
- Preview mode: `python3 newsletter_builder.py --preview`
- Token expires in 60 days, needs manual refresh

### Public Roadmap Removed
- Removed `/roadmap` from public footer navigation and sitemap
- Page still exists at the URL but not discoverable/linked
- Internal checklist remains at `/workspace/ROADMAP.md`
- Commit: 16a187b

### SEO & Site Updates
- Favicon updated: Simple "RC" monogram on blue background (more readable at small sizes)
- Privacy policy live at `/privacy` (GDPR + CCPA compliant)
- Sitemap updated with new blog post
- Google Search Console verified via DNS TXT records (Sean did this)

- 9525cab: Update sitemap with new blog post
- 2009647: Add advanced denial benchmarking Pro tool (later removed)
- Multiple earlier commits from Feb 19 evening session

### Outstanding Items
- **LinkedIn API permissions** — Still 403, expected to activate by noon-2pm CT today
- **PayorMap Railway deployment** — Next priority after Pro resources
- **Pro resource library** — 3 of 15-20 created, remaining in progress
- **Stripe checkout** — Working (Sean confirmed)
- **GDP trades** — Settle today, will be first real P&L test

### Tools & Accounts Status
- **Hunter.io:** Credits exhausted until March 1
- **Apollo.io:** API configured but /people/match requires paid plan
- **Skrapp.io:** Skipped (paywall on API)
- **MailerLite:** Configured and working
- **Stripe:** Working, Pro subscriptions live
- **LinkedIn:** OAuth complete, waiting on API permission activation
- **Google Search Console:** Verified
- **Microsoft Clarity:** Tracking code live on all pages

### Key Decisions
- Auto blog generation = core RevCycleAI feature (daily content engine)
- Pro = content tier, not tool tier
- LinkedIn manual posting until API activates (expected today)
- Pattern matching acceptable for email enrichment (85 verified/mo → 25 verified + unlimited pattern)
- Kalshi auto-scaling ready to compound wins

### Next Session Priorities
1. Finish building 12-17 remaining Pro resources
2. Deploy PayorMap to Railway
3. Test LinkedIn posting once API permissions activate
4. Monitor GDP trade settlement (first real Kalshi P&L)

## Technical Notes

### LinkedIn OAuth SSL Fix
- macOS Python 3.14 has SSL certificate verification issues with urllib
- Solution: Replace urllib.request with requests library
- Updated both linkedin_auth.py and linkedin_poster.py
- Apollo.io API also needs X-Api-Key header (not api_key in body)

### Blog Generator Implementation
- Slugify: lowercase, strip non-word chars, replace spaces with dashes, max 60 chars
- Auto-inserts Axlow CTA when products=['axlow']
- Auto-inserts PayorMap CTA when products=['payormap']
- Updates blog index HTML automatically
- Marks trend as status='published' after blog creation

### Email Enrichment Fallback Chain
- Try Hunter.io first (highest accuracy)
- If 429 (rate limit) or no result → try Apollo.io
- If Apollo fails → pattern matching
- Pattern returns alternatives: [firstname.lastname@, firstnamelastname@, flastname@, etc.]
- Confidence scores: 90-100% (Hunter verified), 85% (Apollo), 50% (pattern match)

## Kalshi Trading Results (9:00 AM CT)

**GDP + CLE settlements:**
- CLE vs BKN YES → WON +$0.10 ✅
- GDP YES 1@$0.90 → LOST -$0.90 ❌
- GDP NO shorts 4@$0.22 → WON +$3.12 ✅ (accidental short turned biggest winner!)

**Session P&L:** +$2.32 (9.3% ROI on $25 starting balance)
**Current Balance:** $23.75
**Win Rate:** 2/3 (67%)
**Open Positions:** 3 (CPI shorts, OKC game)

**Key insight:** The "accidental short" on GDP (thought to be max loss $0.88) became the biggest winner at +$3.12 when GDP came in BELOW 2.0%. Bot mistake = profit.

**All-time realized P&L:** +$2.32 from $25 starting capital.


## PayorMap Deployment Prep (9:30 AM CT)

**Git repository initialized:**
- PayorMap now has its own git repo at `/workspace/payormap/.git`
- Initial commit (e46ab43): "Initial commit: PayorMap v1.5 with UCR Benchmarking Engine"
- 16 files committed:
  - Procfile, Railway.toml, requirements.txt (Railway deployment config)
  - api/app.py (Flask backend)
  - data/ucr_benchmarks.json (51 CDT codes with market benchmarks)
  - data/cdt_allowables.json (68 CDT codes)
  - data/networks.json, payors.json (network mapping data)
  - ui/index.html (7-tab interface with UCR Benchmarking)
  - UCR_README.md (documentation)

**Deployment status:**
- Ready for GitHub push
- User needs to create GitHub repo at https://github.com/new (repo name: `payormap`)
- After push, Railway will auto-deploy
- Domain `payormap.com` already purchased and ready to point

**Next step:** Waiting for user to create GitHub repo, then push and deploy.

## Kalshi Trade Scan (9:36 AM CT)

**Attempted fresh trade scan:**
- Scanned 1,216 active markets
- **Result:** No opportunities ≥4% edge found
- Most markets returned were multi-leg parlays with zero liquidity (provisional markets not yet open for trading)
- **Market is efficient right now** — favorite-longshot bias opportunities already priced in
- Current open positions: 2 (CPI shorts settling Feb 26, OKC game tonight)
- Available slots: 6/8

**Recommendation:** Wait for new markets to open or major news events.


## Minnesota Trade Placed (9:51 AM CT)

**User-initiated manual trade:**
- Found Minnesota vs Dallas game @ 87¢ (87% implied probability)
- Edge: 69.2% (model estimates 96% true probability)
- User chose **Option 2 (Kelly sizing)** — 4 contracts instead of conservative 2
- Order placed: KXNBAGAME-26FEB20DALMIN-MIN
- Execution: FILLED immediately @ $0.87
- Cost: $3.48 (4 × $0.87)
- Fees: $0.04 (taker fees)
- Max profit: $0.52 if Minnesota wins
- Max loss: $3.48 if Dallas wins
- Game time: Tonight 7:00pm CT

**Order ID:** dd454911-9ccd-43fa-b77b-b095fa30dba6

**Portfolio after trade:**
- Balance: $23.75
- Deployed: ~$8.11
- Cash: ~$15.64
- Open positions: 3/8 (CPI shorts, OKC, Minnesota)
- Two games settle tonight (OKC and Minnesota)

**Rationale:** User wanted to bet more than auto-scale cap due to exceptional edge. Kelly criterion recommended $3.56 (15% of bankroll), chose 4 contracts = $3.48 to maximize edge capture.


## Bot Improvements (10:15 AM CT)

**Implemented today:**
1. **Portfolio status command** — `python3 kalshi_bot.py --status`
   - Shows balance, deployed capital, cash available
   - Lists all open positions with unrealized P&L
   - Realized P&L from ledger
   - Quick at-a-glance portfolio view

2. **Midday scan cron** — Daily 12pm CT (cron ID: c1d1eda6)
   - Catches markets that open after 8am scan
   - Minnesota opened between 8am-9:30am, would have caught it
   - Expected impact: 2-5 additional opportunities per week

3. **Comprehensive documentation:**
   - `LESSONS.md` — Analysis of today's trading
   - `IMPROVEMENTS.md` — Roadmap for future enhancements
   - `IMPROVEMENTS_IMPLEMENTED.md` — What's been built

**Key lessons learned:**
- User instinct + bot automation = optimal results
- Minnesota was ONLY ≥5% edge opportunity in 1,200 markets
- Kelly sizing on exceptional edges (>40%) justified
- Midday scan needed to catch newly opened markets
- Model is appropriately selective (not chasing bad trades)

**Scheduled for tomorrow:**
- Kelly override logic (when edge ≥40%, use Kelly sizing instead of auto-scale cap)
- Edge realization tracking (validate model after 20-30 trades)

**Current portfolio status:**
- Balance: $20.23
- Deployed: $8.21
- Cash: $12.02
- Open positions: 3/8
- Realized P&L: +$2.32
- Minnesota showing -$0.08 unrealized (price moved from $0.87 to ~$0.85)
- OKC showing +$0.02 unrealized
