## PayorMap (payormap.com) — NEW PROJECT
**What it is:** B2B SaaS for DSO payor relations teams. Maps every dental PPO leased network relationship. Predicts claim routing probability. Flags silent PPO activity and carve-out opportunities.

**Domain:** payormap.com (purchased tonight on GoDaddy)
**Workspace:** `/Users/shackleton/.openclaw/workspace/payormap/`
**Stack:** Python (Flask API) + vanilla JS UI + JSON data files
**Status:** Working prototype on localhost:5050

**Architecture:**
- `data/networks.json` — 7 umbrella networks (Careington, Connection Dental, Zelis, DenteMax, DNOA, Premier, DHA)
- `data/payors.json` — 16 payors with full network path mappings
- `engine/router.py` — claim routing engine with probability scoring
- `api/app.py` — Flask API (3 endpoints: /api/route, /api/payors, /api/networks)
- `ui/index.html` — 3-tab UI: How It Works | Routing Query | Network Map
- `SECURITY.md` — PHI-free by design

**Key features built:**
- Probability matrix with visual bar charts
- Silent PPO risk flagging
- Override risk warnings
- Complexity score (1-10) per payor
- 4 guided scenarios (MetLife PDP Plus trap, UHC silent PPO, Humana/Zelis, Beam/DenteMax)
- Glossary of key terms
- Network Map tab

**Sales Autopilot:** Full spec written (PDF). Targets DSO VP Revenue Cycle, Director Payor Contracting, VP Operations. Full autonomous outreach engine similar to Axlow autopilot.

## Tomorrow's Build Queue (Priority Order)
1. **Kalshi trade analysis** (2pm CT cron auto-fires) — review results, adjust strategy
2. **PayorMap: Deploy publicly** (Railway or Render) so payormap.com resolves to something real
3. **PayorMap: Stripe integration** — 3 tiers + annual pricing + 14-day trial + Customer Portal
4. **PayorMap: Pricing page** — with updated pricing:
   - 5-25 offices: $497/mo or $4,970/yr
   - 25-75 offices: $997/mo or $9,970/yr
   - 75-200 offices: $2,497/mo or $24,970/yr (bumped from $1,997)
   - 200+ offices: Custom/enterprise (Stripe Invoicing)
5. **PayorMap: US Map overlay** — SVG state map, color-coded by routing/risk per payor
6. **PayorMap: CDT Code allowables tab** — ranges from public Medicaid/TRICARE/VA fee schedules
7. **PayorMap: Expand payor database** — 20+ more payors (Ameritas, Lincoln, Assurant, etc.)
8. **PayorMap: BCBS state-by-state routing** — critical differentiator
9. **PayorMap: Sales autopilot** — clone Axlow pipeline, adapt for DSO ICP
10. **Resend domain verification** — verify payormap.com, send from sean@payormap.com

## Pricing Decisions
- Annual = 10% discount (pay 10, get 12 months)
- 14-day free trial, no credit card
