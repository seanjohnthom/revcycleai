# Session Notes — February 19, 2026

## Kalshi Bot
- Daily 8am scan fired successfully — 1,216 markets scanned, 3 opportunities found
- GDP trades settle Feb 20 (tomorrow): KXGDP-26JAN30-T1.5, T1.75, T2.0 all YES
- **BUG FIXED**: Bot oversold CPI and GDP T2.0 positions due to corrupted ledger entries
  - Root cause: trades.json had ghost entries (KXCPI 33 contracts @ $0.03, KXGDP 5 @ $0.17)
  - Bot tried to close non-existent positions, creating shorts
  - Current shorts: KXCPI-26FEB-T0.1 (-32 contracts, max loss $3.84), KXGDP-T2.0 (-4, max loss $0.88)
  - Sean decided to ride them out (max loss $4.72 total)
- **monitor_positions() patched**: now uses LIVE Kalshi API as source of truth for position count
- `quick_trade.py` created for targeted trades without full scan
- Placed KXGDP-26JAN30-T1.5 YES @ $0.90, 2 contracts ($2.50) — resting
- Balance: $16.86 cash, $8.28 portfolio
- Fixed `place_order()` signature bug (uses `price=` not `limit_price=`)

## PayorMap — Enterprise Redesign
- Full CSS redesign: dark gaming → enterprise light mode
  - Navy header (#0D1F37), white cards with shadows, Inter font
  - Semantic color system (green/amber/red), professional badges
  - PHI-Free pill in top-right header
- 6 tabs: How It Works | Routing Query | US Coverage Map | CDT Allowables | Alerts & News | Networks
- US State Map: SVG, 50 states, color-coded by payor routing risk
  - BCBS/DNOA states (TX, IL, MO, MT, NM, OK) show purple
  - State hover shows routing detail panel
- CDT Allowables: 68 codes across all categories, built from domain knowledge
  - Medicaid range / Network PPO range / UCR median / UCR 90th percentile
- Alerts & News: 3 seed alerts (Zelis rebrand, MetLife PDP Plus, DenteMax growth)
- Running on localhost:5050
- Pricing decided:
  - 5-25 offices: $497/mo or $4,970/yr
  - 25-75 offices: $997/mo or $9,970/yr
  - 75-200 offices: $2,497/mo (bumped from $1,997)
  - 200+: Custom enterprise
  - 14-day free trial, no credit card
- Stripe + deploy scheduled for tonight

## Axlow Leads
- All 100 leads now have personalization_line populated
- Generated from hook_angle + pain_signals data
- master_leads.csv updated
- sheets_webhook.gs updated with update_personalization action (needs redeployment)

## Axlow Viability Audit
- Full research audit completed and PDF sent to Sean
- Verdict: Go all-in — genuine first-mover, no direct AI-powered payor policy search competitor
- Critical gap: zero social proof on axlow.com (site claims 500+ teams but LinkedIn shows 56 followers)
- Wedge market: third-party billing companies (30-40K in US, fastest sales cycle)
- SAM: $151M-$361M at $97/month
- At $1M ARR: worth $8-15M financial, $12-25M strategic acquisition

## RCM Trend Engine — NEW PROJECT
- Built complete trend detection + content monetization engine
- Location: /Users/shackleton/.openclaw/workspace/rcm-trend-engine/
- Stack: Python (Flask) + feedparser + vanilla JS dashboard
- Running on localhost:5051
- Components:
  - engine/signal_sources.py — 14 RSS feeds (CMS, OIG, RevCycle Intel, Becker's, ADA, NADP, etc.)
  - engine/trend_monitor.py — RSS scanner, keyword scorer, urgency classifier
  - engine/content_engine.py — content brief generator, LinkedIn post, X thread generators
  - api/app.py — Flask API (port 5051)
  - ui/index.html — enterprise dashboard matching PayorMap design
- Scoring: keyword tiers (immediate=5pts, strong=3pts, supporting=1pt), urgency levels
- Monetization routing: articles auto-tagged to Axlow or PayorMap
- One-click: Brief → LinkedIn post → X thread from any trending article
- Seeded with 10 realistic articles (CMS prior auth, UHC changes, MetLife PDP Plus, Zelis/Cigna, BCBS Texas DNOA, etc.)
- External RSS feeds work when deployed (sandbox network restricted)
- Next: daily 7am cron, deploy alongside PayorMap

## Sticky Features Discussion
- PHI-free constraint confirmed — no contract upload until SOC 2 trust is earned
- Approved sticky features (all PHI-free):
  1. Network change alerts — push notifications when payor/network relationships change
  2. Carve-out opportunity scanner — identify revenue leakage from network stacking
  3. Contract expiration calendar — manual entry, 90/60/30 day reminders
- Contract analysis (SOC 2 path): 6-month roadmap to earn trust before offering
- Security roadmap: Stage 1 (encryption/ADP now) → Stage 2 (SOC 2 Type I, 3-6mo) → Stage 3 (Type II, pen test, 12mo+)

## Sales Autopilot Discussion
- PayorMap sales autopilot spec reviewed (full PDF)
- ICP: VP Revenue Cycle, Director Payor Contracting, VP Operations at DSOs 25-500+ offices
- Pricing confirmed with bumped 75-200 tier
- Will build sales autopilot after Stripe/deploy (clone Axlow pipeline)

## Tomorrow (Feb 20) Priorities
1. GDP settlement — KXGDP trades resolve, first real P&L
2. Stripe integration for PayorMap (tonight)
3. Deploy PayorMap to payormap.com (tonight)
4. Add daily 7am cron for RCM Trend Engine scan
5. PayorMap: BCBS state-by-state routing detail
6. PayorMap: 20+ more payors
7. Verify payormap.com on Resend for email sending
8. Axlow sheets_webhook.gs redeployment for personalization sync

## RCM Trend Engine PDF (8:29am)
- Sean sent the RCM Trend Engine prompt PDF again (file_7) — likely a resend thinking first didn't go through
- Document cuts off mid-Step 2 (Question 1: Google Trends check) on his end too
- Steps 3-6 (Validate/Create/Publish/Monetize) never came through — awaiting full doc
- Engine is already built and running based on what was received — Sean confirmed it's live

## Comms
- Telegram only going forward — WhatsApp disconnected and will not be reconnected

## revcycleai.com — Full Site Built
- Location: /Users/shackleton/.openclaw/workspace/revcycleai/
- Redesigned from SaaS dark landing page → editorial news publication layout
- Final design: light mode, masthead, breaking ticker, editorial story grid, sidebar (newsletter + action tracker + tools + free resources)
- Wordmark: "Rev" (DM Sans 800) + "Cycle" (DM Sans 400) + thin divider + "AI" blue pill badge — Sean approved this
- Stack: static HTML/CSS, Netlify Functions (MailerLite proxy), netlify.toml
- All pages built: /, /blog, /tools, /free, /newsletter
- Deploy ready: push revcycleai/ to GitHub → Netlify → set MAILERLITE_API_KEY + MAILERLITE_GROUP_ID env vars → connect revcycleai.com domain
- Reminder set for 7pm CT tonight (cron id: bdae2ede-17ef-40b2-8382-f2f7823c53d5)

## Deductible Capital — PE Fund Pitch Deck
- File: file_9 (PPTX), 11 slides
- Fund: $25M Fund I, RCM rollup, 3-4x entry / 8-12x exit, 25-35% target IRR, 3-4x MOIC
- Strategy: Acquire founder-led RCM billing companies → Automate with AI → Scale/exit to strategic/PE
- Target: 5-8 acquisitions, 5-7 year hold
- Gaps identified:
  - Slide 5 (Acquisition Criteria) was empty — needs content
  - Tech assets (Axlow, PayorMap, PPO Playbook) not mentioned — biggest missing moat
  - Fund math tight: $17.5M for acquisitions ÷ 5-8 deals = $2.2-3.5M/deal
  - One-person leadership slide — needs advisors/operating partners
  - No deal pipeline mentioned
- Drafted two new slides: "Proprietary Technology Layer" and enhanced Leadership slide
- Key differentiator: Deductible Capital deploys Axlow/PayorMap/PPO Playbook Day 1 post-acquisition

- Subjects: "Free: See how your denial rate compares to peers" / "What are RCM directors earning in your market?" / "The tool that helps with those denials"

### Kalshi Bot — Ledger Fix
- Cron "kalshi-trade-analysis" fired 2pm CT, got HTTP 401 in isolated session
- Root cause: isolated cron environment couldn't find Python — NOT a real auth failure
  - Fixed: cron now uses full path /usr/local/bin/python3
- trades.json was corrupted — showed +$31.10 fake P&L from ghost entries
  - Ghost entries: KXCPI 33@$0.03 closed @ $0.88 ($28.05 fake PNL), KXGDP 5@$0.17 closed @ $0.78 ($3.05 fake PNL)
  - Both removed. Ledger rebuilt from live API positions.
- **Real P&L to date: $0.00** — no settled trades yet
- Clean ledger now has 6 real positions:
  - KXCPI YES 1@$0.90, KXGDP-T2.0 YES 1@$0.90 (real longs)
  - OKC YES 1@$0.89, CLE YES 1@$0.90 (NBA games)
  - CPI accidental short 32 NO (max loss $3.84), GDP-T2.0 accidental short 4 NO (max loss $0.88)
- Daily scan cron (f48cc523) updated with full Python path + retry on 401

### Logos Generated

- payormap-logo.png — "PayorMap" navy bold + US map outline with connected network nodes
- Both sent to Sean via Telegram
- Purpose: LinkedIn company pages for RevCycleAI and PayorMap

### Current Kalshi Balance (2pm CT)
- Cash: $17.75 | Deployed: $7.67 | Open positions: 6
- GDP T2.0 settles TOMORROW (Feb 20) — first real P&L event

### LinkedIn Setup — IN PROGRESS
- Created RevCycleAI LinkedIn company page (linkedin.com/company/revcycleai or similar)
- Created LinkedIn Developer App: "RevCycleAI Autopilot"
- **Client ID:** 86tgxjfrv6of5b
- **Client Secret:** WPL_AP1.r1I5xKhlEnSETrE0.F4jpaA==
- **Product requested:** "Share on LinkedIn" — STATUS: Pending approval (24-48 hrs typical)
- **OAuth scope needed:** w_organization_social (for company page posting)
- Built scripts:
  - `linkedin_auth.py` — OAuth flow to get access token (run once, saves to .linkedin_token.json)
  - `linkedin_poster.py` — Post text or PDF documents to RevCycleAI company page
- **BLOCKED:** OAuth flow throws "unauthorized_scope_error" until "Share on LinkedIn" product is approved
- Redirect URI added: https://www.linkedin.com/developers/tools/oauth/redirect
- User got approval notification at end of session but OAuth still errored — will debug tomorrow
- Once approved: weekly carousel (Friday noon) will auto-post to LinkedIn

### Weekly Carousel Autopilot
- Cron created: Friday noon CT (id: caff6197-53d9-494d-9988-b86e0cf4f02e)
- Script: rcm-trend-engine/engine/weekly_carousel.py
- Generates 7-slide PDF: cover + 5 trends + CTA
- **Full autopilot** — no manual approval required (Sean trusts the system)
- Posts to RevCycleAI LinkedIn company page automatically
- Currently blocked on LinkedIn product approval

### Free Resources — Placeholder State
- /free page has 6 placeholder resources (download forms)
- **No actual PDFs exist yet** — needs separate work session to create them
- User aware — acknowledged as future work item

### Stripe Integration
- Netlify Function created: netlify/functions/create-checkout.js
- Pro pricing: $29/mo (monthly), $249/yr (annual) — founding member rate locked forever
- **Needs Stripe product setup:**
  1. Create products in Stripe dashboard
  2. Copy Price IDs → add to Netlify env vars (STRIPE_PRICE_MONTHLY, STRIPE_PRICE_ANNUAL)
  3. Fix SITE_URL to include https:// prefix
  4. Redeploy
- /pro page live with pricing info
- /pro/welcome page built (post-checkout success page)

### Git Commits (Evening Session)
- 6ca412d: Remove denial article, add Pro CTA sidebar
- 6d3032f: Fix Pro CTA heading readability
- d56c945: Add Clarity, favicon, sitemap, robots.txt, SEO meta

- 080c9d0: Mobile nav fixes + simpler favicon
- 173d1a4: Root package.json for Stripe
- 387fba4: Mobile overflow fix

### Outstanding Issues
1. **Stripe checkout** — needs SITE_URL env var fix (add https://)
2. **LinkedIn OAuth** — waiting on product approval (24-48 hrs)
3. **Mobile menu bar** — still having issues at end of session, needs further debugging
4. **Stripe products** — need to create monthly/annual products, copy Price IDs
5. **PayorMap Railway deployment** — deferred to next session
6. **Free resources PDFs** — need to create actual downloadable assets

### Next Immediate Steps (from user)
1. Fix Netlify SITE_URL env var (add https://)
2. Create Stripe products → get Price IDs → add to Netlify env
3. Deploy PayorMap to Railway
4. Debug LinkedIn OAuth once approval comes through
5. Fix mobile menu bar issue
