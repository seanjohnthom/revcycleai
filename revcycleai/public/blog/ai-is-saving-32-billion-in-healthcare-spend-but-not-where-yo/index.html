<p class="lead">Four health systems just deployed AI to validate vendor invoices before payment. The technology is preventing <strong>$32 billion in overpayments annually</strong> across a $323 billion spend category.</p>

<p>But here's the twist: this isn't revenue cycle AI. It's supply chain AI.</p>

<p>And it's teaching us exactly what's broken about how we use AI in claims management.</p>

<h2>What Happened</h2>

<p>OSF HealthCare, Kettering Health, MemorialCare, and MUSC Health recently deployed SpendRule's AI platform to automate invoice validation for purchased services — everything from janitorial contracts to IT support to medical equipment maintenance.</p>

<p>The problem they were solving: <strong>Most invoices get approved without validation.</strong></p>

<p>Health systems receive thousands of vendor invoices every month. Finance teams are supposed to verify each line item against the contract terms. But contracts are hundreds of pages long, sitting in filing cabinets (literal or digital), disconnected from the payment approval workflow.</p>

<p>So what happens? Invoices get rubber-stamped. And vendors overbill. A lot.</p>

<p><strong>SpendRule's solution:</strong> Turn contract terms into code.</p>

<p>The AI encodes every pricing term, service level agreement, and payment condition from vendor contracts. Then it validates every invoice line automatically against those encoded terms before payment. Discrepancies get flagged instantly with evidence. No manual approvals needed.</p>

<p>The result? Health systems are catching overbilling <em>before</em> it happens, not chasing refunds after.</p>

<h2>The $32 Billion Question</h2>

<p>If AI can prevent $32 billion in vendor overpayments, why are we still reacting to claim denials <em>after</em> they hit?</p>

<p>Think about the parallels:</p>

<table class="comparison-table">
<thead>
<tr><th>Vendor Invoices (Supply Chain)</th><th>Claim Submissions (Revenue Cycle)</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Vendor sends invoice</td><td>Provider submits claim</td></tr>
<tr><td>Invoice should match contract</td><td>Claim should match payor policy</td></tr>
<tr><td>Most invoices approved without validation</td><td>Most claims submitted without policy validation</td></tr>
<tr><td>Overbilling discovered after payment</td><td>Errors discovered after denial</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>AI validates before payment</strong></td><td><strong>AI predicts denials after submission</strong></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>See the problem?</p>

<p>Revenue cycle teams are using AI <em>reactively</em>. We predict denials after the claim is already wrong. We automate appeals after we've already lost. We track A/R after cash flow is already damaged.</p>

<p>But supply chain teams are using AI <em>proactively</em>. They validate before payment. They catch errors upstream. They prevent problems instead of fixing them.</p>

<h2>Why Revenue Cycle AI Is Backwards</h2>

<p>Most RCM AI vendors sell:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Denial prediction</strong> — "We'll tell you which claims will deny!"</li>
<li><strong>Appeal automation</strong> — "We'll write your denial appeals!"</li>
<li><strong>A/R intelligence</strong> — "We'll prioritize which accounts to work!"</li>
</ul>

<p>These are all useful. But they're all <em>after</em> the damage is done.</p>

<p>What if we flipped the model?</p>

<h2>What Proactive Claims AI Looks Like</h2>

<p><strong>1. Encode Payor Policies Into Code</strong></p>
<p>Just like SpendRule encodes vendor contracts, encode medical necessity criteria, prior auth requirements, and coverage rules. Make them machine-readable.</p>

<p><strong>2. Validate Claims Before Submission</strong></p>
<p>Run every claim through real-time policy validation. Flag coding errors, missing documentation, and eligibility mismatches <em>before</em> the claim goes out.</p>

<p><strong>3. Automate Prior Auth Validation (Not Prediction)</strong></p>
<p>Don't predict whether a service needs prior auth. <em>Know</em> it does. Encode the rules. Trigger auth workflows automatically when criteria are met.</p>

<p><strong>4. Four-Way Matching for Claims</strong></p>
<p>Supply chain uses four-way matching: PO → Receipt → Invoice → Contract. Revenue cycle should too: Service → Documentation → Claim → Payor Policy.</p>

<h2>What To Do Now (48-Hour Action Plan)</h2>

<p><strong>Step 1: Audit Your Top 10 Denial Reasons</strong></p>
<p>Pull your denial data from the last 90 days. Identify the top 10 reasons. If more than 30% are "medical necessity" or "prior auth missing," you have a validation problem, not an appeal problem.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Identify Which Denials Were Preventable</strong></p>
<p>How many denials could have been caught before submission if someone had checked the payor policy? That's your opportunity cost.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Encode One Payor's Medical Necessity Rules</strong></p>
<p>Pick your highest-volume payor. Extract their medical necessity criteria for your top 5 CPT codes. Turn those criteria into a checklist. Validate claims against it before submission for 30 days. Measure denial rate change.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Calculate the ROI of Prevention vs. Recovery</strong></p>
<p>Vendor invoice AI saves $32B by preventing overpayments. What would you save by preventing denials instead of appealing them?</p>

<p>Example math:</p>
<ul>
<li>1,000 claims/month × 15% denial rate = 150 denials</li>
<li>50% of denials are preventable = 75 claims</li>
<li>Average claim value = $500</li>
<li>Preventable losses = $37,500/month = <strong>$450,000/year</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Now compare that to what you're spending on appeal automation.</p>

<h2>The Bigger Lesson</h2>

<p>SpendRule's CTO said it best: <em>"Most contracts sit in a filing cabinet, disconnected from the payments they're supposed to govern."</em></p>

<p>Swap "contracts" for "payor policies" and "payments" for "claims," and you've described revenue cycle management in 2026.</p>

<p>The breakthrough isn't the AI. It's the shift from <strong>reactive to proactive</strong>. From damage control to damage prevention. From predicting failures to preventing them.</p>

<p>Your claims are just invoices to payors. It's time to treat them like supply chain does.</p>
